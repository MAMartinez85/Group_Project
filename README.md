## Things we enjoyed or learned from this project:
1. Bringing everything we learned together for a final big project.
2. Working with a partner and collaborating on ideas. We decided to continue working on another project after this course as we got familiar with our strengths and weaknesses. 

## Things we didn't enjoy or wanted to learn from this project: 
1. We wanted to learn more about how react frontend and Flask backend work together, but due to limited time we had to skip.
2. Having to scrap ideas due to no having enough time or knowledge on the subject. The main thing we wanted out of the app was to include a goals feature with reminders to help you complete tasks. Also the ability to fill up remaining time of the day with more tasks by getting a notification. This schedule should have been easily integrated with Google Calender API, but again working with limited time created issues.   

## Technical Requirments: 
- Flask Server
- Postgres Database
- REST API Integration 
- User Login
- Beautification
